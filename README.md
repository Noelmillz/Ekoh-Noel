Hi there, I'm Noel EkohðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate and dedicated data scientist with a fresh perspective, eager to apply my skills and knowledge in solving real-world problems. Recently, I completed a rigorous data science bootcamp that equipped me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## ðŸ”­ Background and Experience
During my bootcamp experience, I worked on various projects that involved exploring diverse datasets, developing predictive models, and extracting meaningful insights. I have hands-on experience with popular programming languages such as Python and R, as well as data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

Additionally, I have a strong understanding of machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. I'm skilled in model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance. Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing are also areas where I excel, enabling me to clean and transform data effectively.

## ðŸŒ± Passion for Continuous Learning
As a data scientist, I understand the significance of staying up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques. I have a deep curiosity and an appetite for continuous learning, which drives me to explore emerging trends in the field. I actively engage with online communities and attend webinars.

## ðŸ’¼ Projects and Accomplishments
- [Finance Calculators](https://github.com/Noelmillz/finalCapstone/blob/main/finance_calculators.py) : Wrote a Python program that allows users to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform financial calculations such as interest calculations for investments and monthly repayment calculations for home loans. 

- Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn: Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company, achieving an accuracy of 85% and enabling targeted retention strategies.

- Sentiment Analysis for Social Media: Utilized natural language processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset of tweets, enabling businesses to understand customer sentiment and make data-driven decisions.

- Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks: Built a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of different species of flowers, achieving an accuracy of 92% on the test set.

- Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard: Created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to explore and visualize trends in a real estate dataset, allowing stakeholders to gain actionable insights and make informed decisions.
